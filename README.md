# Wisemonie Website

A modern, responsive landing page for the Wisemonie finance app.

## How to Run

Since this is a static website built with HTML and Tailwind CSS (via CDN), you don't need to install any complex dependencies.

### Option 1: The Simple Way (Double Click)
1.  Navigate to this folder in your File Explorer: `c:\Users\abrah\Desktop\moniewise_website`
2.  Double-click **`moniewise.html`**.
3.  It will open in your default web browser.

### Option 2: Local Server (Recommended)
Running a local server avoids some browser security restrictions and mimics a real web environment.

1.  Open your terminal/command prompt in this folder.
2.  Run the following Python command:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
3.  Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:8000/moniewise.html](http://localhost:8000/moniewise.html)

## Customization
-   **Main File:** `moniewise.html` contains all the structure and content.
-   **Images:** All assets are in the `images/` folder.
-   **Logo:** The animated logo is `images/wisemonie_logo_movement.gif`.
